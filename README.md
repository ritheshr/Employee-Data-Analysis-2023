# 🧾 Employee Salary Data Analysis & Visualization
This project involves analyzing and visualizing a dataset of employee salary records to identify trends, correlations, and insights across multiple salary components like base pay, overtime, and longevity bonuses. The analysis was performed using Python with a strong focus on data cleaning, statistical analysis, and meaningful visualizations.

# 📊 Project Highlights
Dataset: Over 10,000 employee salary records.

Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, reduced the dataset from 10,291 to 10,258 clean records.

Statistical Analysis: Summarized base salary, overtime, and longevity pay using:

Mean

Median

Standard Deviation

Visualization Tools:

Histograms: Distribution of salary components.

Pie Charts: Employee proportions by salary bins.

3D Scatter Plots: Relationships between salary types.

Area Charts: Mean longevity pay trends.

# 🔍 Insights
Most employees earn lower base and overtime salaries.

Right-skewed distributions for most salary components.

Strong correlation between base salary and overtime/longevity pay.

Revealed potential areas for pay structure improvements and equity analysis.
